Hey stranger, I am a Computer Science Masters student at the University of Southern California. I am a research assistant with the FORT-ML and the [DILL](https://dill-lab.github.io/) groups at USC and am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Sai Praneeth Karimireddy](https://spkreddy.org/) and [Prof. Swabha Swayamdipta](https://swabhs.com/). Previously, I completed my Bachelor's in CS
 at IIT Guwahati.

I am interested in exploring machine behaviour and understanding how we can attribute (and perhaps predict!) Large Language Model behaviour by looking at one or more of the these three: the training data, the model outputs and the model architecture.

Currently, I am working on memorization in LLMs and data selection for post-training. Feel free to reach out if any of this interests you!

    I graduate in May 2026 and am open to machine learning research and software engineering
    positions in the industry.
